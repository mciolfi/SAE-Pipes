Burst test on damaged pipes
Hydraulic brake pipes are responsible for fluid flows and as consequence the right functionality of the most important safety system in the vehicle. Even that, this part has no much development since it was applied in the 1930s. In fact, the brake pipes are particularly vulnerable component, being mainly in an exposed condition under the vehicle. Externally it has to survive a wide range of environmental conditions whereas internally it must withstand pressurized brake fluid. Failure of brake tubing is an obvious safety hazard. This paper attempts to present the results achieved in vehicle simulation and bench test, simulating an interference of brake pipe with a sharper edge and what are the consequences of lifetime and functionally of brake pipes and the complete brake system.
